# gc (Good Commands)

Orchestrate good commands with your desired way. It's a CLI for aggregate and execute commands with command line way. "gc" means "Good Command". **(Maybe Garbage Command. LOL)**

## Usage scenario

### 1. Get changed files from git repo.

In some companies, when you create a PR for code review. Sometimes you need generate the changed files from your branch. And you need paste those stuff in the PR description. you can borrow "gc" to simplify these work.

### 2. Shorten long commands into concise commands

You can customize and aggregate long commands into small commands. all of stuff can be configurable.

## Configuration

When gc initialized, it will automatically create .gc_config file under the home path. for MacOS user, you can find from ~/.gc_config. Configuration stores with json format. can be changed manually.

```json
{
  "app": "App",
  "version": "Version",
  "source": "https://github.com/Anyone-Developers/gc",
  "commands": {
    "git-cached-changes": {
      "type": "String",
      "name": "git-cached-changes",
      "detail": "git diff --name-only --cached #0",
      "prefix": " [x] ",
      "suffix": null
    },
    "git-changes-branches": {
      "type": "String",
      "name": "git-changes-branches",
      "detail": "git diff --name-only #0 #1",
      "prefix": " [x] ",
      "suffix": "ðŸš€"
    },
    "git-test": {
      "type": "String",
      "name": "git-test",
      "detail": "git diff agsfd",
      "prefix": null,
      "suffix": null
    },
    "git-changes": {
      "type": "String",
      "name": "git-changes",
      "detail": "git diff --name-only",
      "prefix": " [x] ",
      "suffix": "ðŸš€"
    }
  }
}
```
